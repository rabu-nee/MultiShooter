# MultiShooter
gamedev final homework

This project was created with Unity 2018.2 and will probably need to be opened with this version due to Unity 2018.2's new Package Manager System.
If there are errors concerning Cinemachine, install it with the Package Manager.

Play with a twin stick controller for best experience!

Controls (keyboard):
shoot - space
move - A S D W
rotate - arrow keys

Controls (twin stick):
shoot - Triggers (mapped for XBox360 - if the mapping does not work for your controller, go to the Input settings and change the Input for "Fire1" accordingly
move - left stick
rotate - right stick


How to play:
1. start the game
2. Host and join as Client respectively
3. Press "Start Game" button as host AFTER everyone joined, otherwise late joiners might not see the same map as everyone else
4. shoot the enemy - friendly fire exists ;)


Known "Features"
- enemies are sometimes spawned on the wrong lane, making it impossible to shoot them - restart the game when it happens!
- even if the chance is actually small, obstacles and enemies are oddly often spawned on the same spot, making it appear as though they have double HP or thrice HP (sometimes even four times HP)
- visual healthbar of clients does not reset but worry not, HP does reset
- if you are lucky, you spawn on an enemy/obstacle/player
- end screen and exit button is only visible on host
